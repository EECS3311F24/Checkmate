**2. Decision Making:**
We devised our decision-making process with the project target and efficiency in mind.

-Technical Decisions:

    1. Frontend Developer suggests implementation features for UI/UX (for eg. themes, mobile support)
    2. Backend Developer propose solutions for server-side features such as matchmaking system, and game history.
    3. Weekly meetings are conducted every Wednesday for 2 hours.
    4. The agreement is reached through voting.
    
-Feature Prioritization:

    1. The project Manager finalizes the sprint backlog based on the voting agreement.
    2. Frontend and Backend Developers review user stories.
    3. Team discusses possible new features to be implemented or to be updated

-User Experience Decisions:

    1. Frontend Developers present mockups for user-facing features(eg. Lobby chat, customization options).
    2. The team provides feedback considering different user personas(Karen, Jack, Joe).
    3. Final approval for the project is decided in weekly meetings.
    4. Team members are encouraged to discuss any conflicts openly in the meetings.

**3. Prioritizing User Stories**
Our prioritization of user stories is essential for ensuring that the team delivers the most valuable features first. We have established a 1 - 3 range for all criteria to achieve our targeted goals.

    1. Core Functionality: Is this a must-have feature for a chess platform?
    2. User Impact: How many users will benefit and to what degree? (for eg. Guest-Play impacts many casual users like Jake)
    3. Social Engagement: How much does this feature enhance social interaction for users like Joe?
    4. Learning Curve: How much will this feature help new users like Karen learn and enjoy chess?

-Top priority features based on this system might include:

    1. User Registration/Accounts
    2. Guest Play
    3. Game Lobbies
    4. Tutorial for Beginners
    5. Mobile Support
    6. Turn-Based Mode
    7. Timer Mode
    8. Matchmaking System
    9. Friend System
    10. Game History/Replay
    11. Training Mode
    12. Ranking System
    13. Custom Games
    14. Rewind Move System (for practice games)
    15. Notification System

Low Priority features list includes:

    1. Daily Chess Trivia
    2. Themes & Local Customization
    3. Multiple Language Support
    4. Spectator System
    5. Lobby Chat
    6. Team-Based Games
    7. Daily Chess Puzzles
    8. Game Analysis
    9. Advanced Customization Options

This prioritization ensures we focus on delivering a functional, engaging chess platform first, with room to add more advanced or niche features in future development cycles.

**4. Meetings**
Our team has a structured meeting schedule to ensure regular communication and progress.

Sprint Planning Sessions(2 Hours, every Wednesday lab time): 

       1. Review and estimate user stories.
       2. Assign initial tasks to Frontend and Backend teams.
       3. Discuss potential issues with features.
   
Sprint Review Sessions(1 Hour, once a week):

      1. Frontend Developers demonstrate completed features and working of chess UX/UI design.
      2. Backend Developers present completed APIs and database and runtime build configurations.
      3. Note down all the feedback and important discussions in the doc and update in Trello.
      
Sprint Outlook Sessions(20 mins, after the class):

      1. Discuss what went well, and what could be further improved moving forward.
      2. Quality Assurance is thoroughly done on all the parts of the project.
      3. Each member reports on yesterday’s progress, today’s plan, future plan, and any other technical outbreak reports.
	
Additional Updates(Discord chat and voice calls):

      1. Discuss any challenges faced in making the right decisions for the project.
      2. Code reviews are done between frontend and backend teams to ensure deadlines are met.
      3.Github log is used to manage the project timeline and initial commits.
      4. The team puts new discussion topics in chat if any advanced technical difficulties surfaced.

*Note: All the meetings are planned in advance considering everyone’s schedule conflicts. Meetings are held either in-person or via zoom depending on availability of each member.*


**5. Next Phase:**
For the next phase of our project, we have focused on some key areas in our user stories and team organization.

1. Core Gameplay and User Authentification:

      1. Frontend developers will implement chessboard UI, piece movement, registration, and login interfaces.
      2. Backend Developers will develop game state management, move validation, user authentication, and database management.
      3. Quality Assurance will done to get the test game logic right, user interactions, account creation, and login processes Focus: Turn-Based Mode, Timer-Mode, User Registeration/Accounts, Guest Play
   
3. Matchmaking and Game Lobbies:
   
      1. Frontend Developers will design lobby UI, matchmaking interface, lobby system backend, and friend system
      2. The backend Developer will develop a matchmaking algorithm, lobby system backend, and friend connections.
      3. Quality assurance will be carried out for testing matchmaking fairness, lobby functionality, and social features such: Game Lobbies, Matchmaking System, Friend System, Custom Games.

This phased approach allows us to build and refine core features that cater to a wide range of users, from beginners like Karen to experienced players like Jake, while also fostering the social connections important to users like Joe.
