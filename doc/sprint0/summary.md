The Project Objective:

Build a website that allows users to play chess online. Users can register for an account and play with friends or other users through matchmaking. Standard chess as well as custom modes can be played.

Key Personas:

Jake - a 17 year old high school boy who loves playing video games, board games and spends a lot of his time on computers. He enjoys puzzle solving outside of school hours and is generally quite competitive. He gets good grades and likes to stay indoors. Teachers often tell him he has potential.

Karen - a recently divorced 40 year old accountant who is tired of her mundane day to day work and has too much leisure time and wants to find a new hobby to invest her energy in. She has recently moved to a new country so all her friends and family are abroad and she frequently connects with them online and plays friendly matches of tic tac toe and other simple games.

Joe - a 64 year old male who is about to retire from his construction job. His full time job is a construction worker but he plays competitive chess in his leisure time and has 40 years of experience playing chess. His chess matches are usually in person. His group of coworkers and him all enjoy the game and play together during lunch hours at the construction site. He wants a way to keep their tradition alive since he will be leaving the company soon.


Key Scenarios:

Karen wants to find a new hobby to spend her time on and her overseas friends recently asked her to play chess but she has never played a single game in her life. She wants to learn in an interactive way instead of just watching YouTube videos on how to play. 

Jake has played a few games of chess in his school with his classmates. But now summer break is here and they live far away from each other. They would like to stay connected and play frequent games together. When they played chess in person, they liked creating their own rules by setting shorter timers every round and removing certain pieces from the board at the start of the game. 

Joe recently heard from his grandson about our chess website which allows him to play with his friends online with game analysis functionality which he is deeply intrigued by. He is new to using computers and does not believe a computer can analyze how good his moves are and wants to try out this "new technology" he has recently come to find out about.


Key Principles:

A simple to use website for users of all skill levels to be able to easily navigate and enjoy the game. 

A streamlined experience provided for users who want to connect via a chess match with friends online.
