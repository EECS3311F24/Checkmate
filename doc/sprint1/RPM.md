[2023-10-22] Release Planning Meeting For Sprint # 1:

Date: 2024-10-22
Participants: Werner, Jaimin, Monica, Flavio
Meeting Agenda
Review Sprint 1 Goals
Identify User Stories to work on for Sprint 1
Assign Preliminary Task Breakdown and Responsibilities

1. Sprint 1 Goals
For Sprint 1, our primary goal is to implement at least two listed features in our user stories with the focus on the core features required to run our checkmate project. We also want to figure out the required time needed to complete each feature and how to format the sprint documents as required by the rubric. 

2. User Stories for Sprint 1
The following user stories were selected by the group for Sprint 1, prioritized based on user value and project objectives:
Guest Play
Allows users to play a match of chess without creating an account, ensuring accessibility for casual users.
Multiple Language Support
Provides language options for users, expanding inclusivity and accessibility for users who don’t speak the same language as the development team.
Timer Mode
Adds a time-based challenge to gameplay, enhancing engagement and improving users’ decision-making under time constraints.
Tutorial on How to Play for Beginners
Offers an interactive tutorial for new players, aligning with our mission to create a welcoming and educational environment for beginner chess players.
Themes & Local Customization
Customization options for board themes, piece styles, and colors.
We also determined the amount of points via agile each user stories we selected for this sprint: 
User Story Point Estimations
Guest Play – 3 Points: This is a small but critical feature that involves enabling guest login without account creation. It requires some backend work for user session management but isn’t overly complex.
Multiple Language Support – 5 Points: Implementing multilingual support involves translating UI text and possibly managing language files. While it’s not particularly difficult, it does require time and attention to detail, especially to ensure no UI issues arise with different language lengths.
Timer Mode – 8 Points: Adding a timer requires front-end and back-end changes to manage timing, potential game-state updates, and user notifications. The complexity is moderate to high due to the real-time component and UI considerations.
Tutorial on How to Play for Beginners – 8 Points: This requires a guided, interactive experience for new users, with potential animations and instructional overlays. It’s complex and involves careful planning to ensure accessibility and clarity for beginners.
Themes & Local Customization – 8 Points: Implementing themes requires developing customizable UI components and providing options for theme selection (e.g., light and dark modes or color themes). Local customization may involve adapting the interface to accommodate different regional preferences, which adds another layer of complexity.

3. Preliminary Task Breakdown
Each user story will be divided into tasks to manage workflow effectively. We also need to assign tasks for the other project requirements. Initial task outlines are as follows:
Guest Play
Design and develop guest access mode
Set access limitations for guest users
Testing and debugging guest functionality
Multiple Language Support
Identify and implement languages
Create language selection interface
Testing for language-specific UI consistency
Timer Mode
Design timer options (e.g., blitz, rapid)
Implement timer mechanics
Testing and adjustments based on feedback
Tutorial on How to Play for Beginners
Design tutorial flow and interactive elements
Develop tutorial content with step-by-step instructions
Testing tutorial interactions for clarity and usability
Themes & Local Customization 
Design a UI component allowing users to select their preferred theme.
Ensure compatibility with the existing UI structure.
Code Structure and Organization
Describe the organization of the codebase, including folder structure and key modules.
Write detailed documentation for core classes, modules, and functions.
Outline any testing tools or frameworks and how to run tests locally.
Project/Sprint Documentation
Write a concise overview of the project, including objectives, goals, and key requirements (sprint and standups). 
Review the entire document for clarity, consistency, and completeness.
Edit for grammar, style, and formatting consistency.

Responsibilities 

Each of these tasks will be assigned to a group member to handle during this sprint, for the local customization / timer mode / tutorial tasks these will be assessed and determined if these can be completed during the 1st sprint. If these tasks cannot be reasonably completed before the deadline on Nov 3rd then these tasks will be moved for the 2nd sprint with the reason being added to their user story trello card. The tasks have been assigned to the following group members:

Project/Sprint Documentation: Flavio
Code Structure and Organization: Werner
Themes & Local Customization: Flavio (To assess feasibility) 
Tutorial on How to Play for Beginners: Flavio (To assess feasibility) 
Timer Mode: Flavio (To assess feasibility) 
Guest Play: Monica (Core Logic) & Jaimin (Visuals)
The task tickets for Trello are as follows: 


01 Implement Chess Game Logic 
02 Update Code Documentation
03 Implement Multi Language Code for Front End
04 Update Sprint and Sprint Release Documentation
05 Create Chess Visuals
Further updates to task completion or changes to the tasks will be documented in sprint1.md.
