Date: 2024-11-03

Participants: Werner, Jaimin, Monica, Flavio

Notetaker: Flavio Araujo Silva

Unfinished User Stories:

Tutorial on How to Play for Beginners

As a beginner, I want to have a tutorial available, so that I can learn the basics of chess.

Tasks remaining:

Create UI components for the tutorial.

Record content explaining chess rules for beginners.

Reason: The Tutorial feature was removed from Sprint 1 due to the need to focus on core game functionality first. The tutorial relies on the fully implemented game logic and visuals, and these were not yet stable. Once the core game features are in place, we can prioritize delivering an engaging, beginner-friendly tutorial.

Themes & Local Customization

As Karen, I want to customize the look of the chessboard and pieces, so that the game feels more personal and visually appealing to me. Tasks remaining:

Implement customizable UI components for theme selection (e.g., dark, light, classic, modern).

Add piece styles (e.g., classic, minimalist, themed).

Enable color customization for both board and pieces.

Ensure all customization settings are saved for registered users across sessions.

Reason: Themes & Local Customization was deprioritized to focus on stabilizing core features before adding customizable elements. The customization relies on stable UI components, which are still undergoing development and testing.

Timer Mode

As Jake, I want to challenge myself with a timer mode for each turn, so that I can improve my speed and decision-making skills.

Tasks remaining:

Implement a timer feature to set a limit for each turn (e.g., blitz or rapid chess).

Ensure stable core gameplay to support timed modes effectively.

Reason: Timer Mode was postponed as it depends on ensuring core chess logic stability. Developing and testing a stable timer feature requires reliable game mechanics, and the focus was on solidifying these first.

Unfinished tasks will be moved to SR1.md in the form of new/updated user stories for the next sprint.

Practices to Continue During Next Sprint:

Regular Stand-up Meetings: Daily check-ins were effective in ensuring everyone was on track.

Good Communication and Collaboration: Using Trello for task assignment and Discord for quick communications worked well.

Pair Programming: Pair programming sessions were productive and helped ensure code quality.

New Practices to Consider During Next Sprint:

Dedicated Testing Time: Allocate time at the end of each sprint solely for testing to avoid unfinished testing tasks.

User Feedback Integration: Schedule a session to gather feedback from potential users after developing new features, which could lead to quicker adjustments.

Harmful Practices to Stop During Next Sprint:

Scope Creep: Avoid adding last-minute features or tasks without consensus. It led to unfinished tasks in this sprint.

Best/Worst Experiences During Sprint 1:

Best Experience: Collaborating on the UI design for the Chess Game component. The process was creative, and the team felt satisfied with the final outcome.

Worst Experience: Facing challenges integrating the translation system. The lack of a standardized approach initially slowed down development.
