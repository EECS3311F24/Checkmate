Notetaker: Flavio

For sprint 2 we have planned to work on the following four user stories for the duration of sprint 2:

Saving User Data: Players info can be saved between sessions, be it their stats or other choices.

Custom Games: Players can customize game settings, such as piece removal, time limits, or unique rule sets.

Timer Mode: Adds a time-based challenge to gameplay, enhancing engagement and improving users’ decision-making under time constraints.

Themes & Local Customization: Customization options for board themes, piece styles, and colors.

We also determined the amount of points via agile each user stories we selected for this sprint:

User Story Point Estimations

Saving User Data - 10 Points: Requires that the database for the website can correctly save, load, and overwrite data set for each user. Such a feature needs to be working on different operating systems like Linux, Windows, and MacOs.

Custom Games – 10 Points: Requires customization of game logic and UI to support rule variations and configurations.

Timer Mode – 8 Points: Adding a timer requires front-end and back-end changes to manage timing, potential game-state updates, and user notifications. The complexity is moderate to high due to the real-time component and UI considerations.

Themes & Local Customization – 8 Points: Implementing themes requires developing customizable UI components and providing options for theme selection (e.g., light and dark modes or color themes). Local customization may involve adapting the interface to accommodate different regional preferences, which adds another layer of complexity.

Preliminary Task Breakdown

Each user story will be divided into tasks to manage workflow effectively. We also need to assign tasks for the other project requirements. Initial task outlines are as follows:

Responsibilities

Each of these tasks will be assigned to a group member to handle during this sprint. If these tasks cannot be reasonably completed before the deadline on Nov 17th then these tasks will be moved for the 3nd sprint with the reason being added to their user story trello card. The tasks have been assigned to the following group members:

Custom Games: Monica

Themes & Local Customization: Flavio 

Timer Mode: Jaiminkumar

Saving User Data: Werner

The task tickets for Trello are as follows:

Task 06 Implement Custom Game Logic

Task 07 Implement Saving User Data

Task 08 Implement Themes & Visual Customization

Task 09 Implement Timer Mode
