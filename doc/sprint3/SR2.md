Remaining User Stories from PB.md:
User Story: Game Lobbies

As Joe (a retiring worker), I want to join game lobbies with my friends so that I can easily set up matches and continue our tradition of lunchtime chess games.

Acceptance Criteria:

    The lobby system allows users to create or join rooms with friends.
    Players in the lobby can set preferences such as time limits and game mode.
    The lobby shows which friends are currently online and available for games.

Priority: Low
Estimated Points: 8 Points (Involves lobby creation, real-time room joining, and user interface updates for online status).

As Joe, I want to chat with my friends in the game lobby, so that we can discuss the game setup and socialize before and after matches.

Acceptance Criteria:

    The lobby includes a simple text-based chat for users to communicate in real-time.
    Chat logs are saved within the session but are cleared after the session ends.
    Users can mute the chat if they prefer not to participate.

User Story: Game History/Replay

As Joe, I want to view my game history and watch replays, so that I can review past games and analyze my performance.

Acceptance Criteria:

    A history log shows all past games, sortable by date and opponent.
    Users can select any game from the history to watch a replay, viewing moves step-by-step.

Practices to Continue During Next Sprint:

    Regular Stand-up Meetings: Daily check-ins were effective in ensuring everyone was on track.
    Good Communication and Collaboration: Using Trello for task assignment and Discord for quick communications worked well.
    Pair Programming: Pair programming sessions were productive and helped ensure code quality.

New Practices to Consider During Next Sprint:

    Dedicated Sprint Planning: Allocate more detailed planning time to avoid ambiguity in task requirements.
    User Testing Sessions: Gather targeted feedback from users after implementing new features to ensure the features meet user needs effectively.

Harmful Practices to Stop During Next Sprint:

    Rushing Feature Deployment: Avoid last-minute deployment of new features that havenâ€™t been thoroughly reviewed or tested. It resulted in integration delays and avoidable errors during this sprint.

Best/Worst Experiences During Sprint 2:

Best Experience:
Collaborating on integrating real-time gameplay mechanics with the user interface. The synergy among team members was high, and the successful result boosted morale.

Worst Experience:
Delays caused by miscommunication regarding server configuration. This setback highlighted the need for better documentation and coordination in managing shared resources.
