For sprint 3 we have planned to work on the following four user stories for the duration of sprint 3:

User Story: Game Lobbies (Allow players to create lobbies when playing chess and to allow players to join in a lobby given space)

User Story: Lobby Chat (Allow players to chat with each other in a chat box on the chess board screen)

User Story: Game History/Replay (Allow players to view over the history of a game and to view moves done)

We also determined the amount of points via agile each user stories we selected for this sprint:

User Story Point Estimations

Game Lobbies - 8 Points: Involves lobby creation, real-time room joining, and user interface updates for online status.

Lobby Chat – 4 Points: Basic real-time chat functionality, with optional mute and session-based clearing.

Game History/Replay – 6 Points: Requires backend support for saving game data, replay functionality, and a user interface for viewing history and replays.

Preliminary Task Breakdown

Each user story will be divided into tasks to manage workflow effectively. We also need to assign tasks for the other project requirements. Initial task outlines are as follows:

Responsibilities

Each of these tasks will be assigned to a group member to handle during this sprint. If these tasks cannot be reasonably completed before the deadline on Dec 1st then these tasks will be given a reason for thier delay with that being added to their user story trello card. The tasks have been assigned to the following group members:


Task 10 Game Lobby Frontend (Flavio)

Task 11 Game Lobby Backend (Werner)

Task 12 Lobby Chat Frontend (Flavio)

Task 13 Lobby Chat Backend (Werner)

Task 14 Game History/Replay Frontend (Jaiminkumar)
