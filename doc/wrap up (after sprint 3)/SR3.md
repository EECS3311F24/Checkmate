Sprint 3 Retrospective Meeting - SR3.md

Date: 2024-12-01
Participants: Werner, Jaimin, Monica, Flavio
Notetaker: Flavio Araujo Silva
Unfinished User Stories:

Any remaining User Stories are documented in the PB.md file located in the same folder. As in the previous sprints, we have successfully completed all user stories without the need to add new ones. 

This indicates that we planned a balanced workload and good task distribution at the start of this project, allowing us to focus on quality and efficiency during each sprint.

New Practices to Consider:

    Dedicated Sprint Planning:
        Allocate more detailed planning time at the start of each sprint to avoid ambiguity in task requirements.
        This would help us better understand task dependencies, prepare for potential obstacles, and reduce the risk of miscommunication.

    User Testing Sessions:
        Implement user testing sessions immediately after the implementation of major features to gather targeted feedback.
        This will ensure that newly implemented features meet the intended user needs effectively and allow us to adapt before full deployment.

Harmful Practices to Stop Doing:

    Ignoring Technical Debt:
        During this sprint, we often prioritized adding new features over addressing existing technical debt. This resulted in an accumulation of underlying issues that made later development more cumbersome.
        Moving forward, we will allocate specific time each sprint to address technical debt, ensuring that our codebase remains maintainable and reducing the risk of introducing bugs due to unchecked complexity.

Best/Worst Experiences During Sprint 3:

Best Experience:

    Collaborative Integration of Real-Time Gameplay Mechanics:
        One of the highlights of Sprint 3 was the collaboration among team members to integrate each other's workload quickly and easily.
        The level of communication, mutual support, and teamwork was exceptionally high, and the successful outcome significantly boosted team morale and confidence in our project.

Worst Experience:

    Unexpected outisde issues:
        One major hiccup our team had to deal with was an outside issues (laptop broken due to a family mishap) which caused a delay in feature completion but thankfully the team was able
        to work around this issue and complete all tasks and checklists before the deadline as this happened on the last weekend of Sprit 3.
